                        <p>Hannes Runel√∂v had the original idea for the core mechanics of the game, such as rolling and attaching to other cubes. He also developed these mechanics in addition to some environment interactions, level design, setting up the initial project structure, Omino creature animations, as well as shaders, such as ice and conveyor belts.</p>
                        <p>Everything else that you see and hear in the game was designed and developed by Jesper Englund, including game logic, level editor, data architecture, UI, movement mechanics and environment interactions, level design, music, sound effects, skyboxes and this website. Jesper is the only one still working on the project.</p>
